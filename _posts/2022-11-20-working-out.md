## Working Out

I've been struggling with my weight for the last 7+ years. I spent a few of those years in some type of denial. But, in the last couple of years I've been trying to get into better shape. 

Before the pandemic, I signed up to do a half ironman. That year I lost a decent amount of weight and got my BMI down from obese to overweight. But, the half ironman got cancelled and I got diagnosed with a minor but life altering health issue that same year. Not fun. 

The health issue isn't significant but it affected my ability to run. Not being able to run made it hard for me to control my weight since running was my main form of exercise. So, I ended up putting on all the weight I loss and more.

Earlier this year, not deterred by the setback, I changed up my diet and started indoor cycling. And a few months ago I signed up for personal trainings. The personal trainings were more enjoyable than I expected. The most important part was that there was someone there holding me accountable.

I don't know why I didn't do it earlier. Stubbornness? Laziness? Denial? Anyway, I decided to join a Crossfit gym...

Long story short, I'm hoping in the next couple of months I'll be able to:
- Get my weight under 175lbs
- Bench 200 lbs
- Squat 225 lbs
- Deadlift 250 lbs
- Run a 5K again
